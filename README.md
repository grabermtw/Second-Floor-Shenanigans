# Second Floor Shenanigans
## An interactive experience the people of DCC, and a template to follow for anyone who wishes to create a similar experience
*Second Floor Shenanigans* currently consists of seven minigames, six of which are specific to certain people, and a seventh featuring 30 different people. I have made this entire project to be open source with the intention of enabling anyone to create a similar experience for their own friends of family. By cloning this repository, you are given seven fully-playable games, which you can then very easily adapt whichever you'd like to fit your own experiences. This can easily be accomplished by replacing the given visual assets with your own. For example:

"Anders Makes It Rain" is a game with very simple mechanics, the only objective being to avoid things falling from the sky. Speaking from personal experience, this format of a game can easily be applied to any person or theme you can imagine. 

"Hot Takes With Nate Rogers" is a bit of a different story. While the in-game premise of Nate starting a newspaper is indeed specific to Nate Rogers, the mechanic of the game, randomly generating silly sentences from a list of given phrases and words, can be applied to anyone or anything with hilarious results. Simply edit HotTakeGenerator.cs to replace the UMD and DCC-specific phrases with your own.

"Flying With Fred," "Emily and Emma's Meteorite Madness," "World Of Omer," and "Stacking With Jesse" can all be modified easily to fit whatever person or theme you desire, very similarly to "Anders Makes It Rain." 

## The games, in their current form:

### Flash Mob
This game was created as a variation on the DCC Flash Mob that took place in the fall of 2017. The objective is to reach the Testudo statue in front of McKeldin Library without being caught by another participant in the Flash Mob. There are 30 playable characters, whoever you don't pick will be a part of the mob.

### Anders Makes It Rain
A game in which the player helps Anders avoid $100 bills that are falling from the sky, as Anders is suffering from success and does not want any more money.

### Hot Takes With Nate Rogers
A game in which the player picks the best of two randomly-generated sentences, based on what categories are "hot".

### Flying With Fred
A game in which the player flies a plane through the air collecting CDs tied to balloons while simeltaneously avoiding other aircraft.

### Emily and Emma's Meteorite Madness
A game in which the player helps Emily or Emma collect meteorites, while avoiding meteors falling from the sky. This game has both a single player mode and a multiplayer mode.

### World Of Omer
A game in which the player attempts to select the correct translation of as many randomly generated sentences as possible.

### Stacking With Jesse
A game in which the player assists Jesse in creating the tallest cup stack possible.
